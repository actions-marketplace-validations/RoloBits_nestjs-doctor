# nestjs-doctor-lsp

## 4.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Print one line on the first console scan on a machine pointing at the VS Code extension and the `nestjs-doctor-lsp` language server, then never again, and never in CI, inside a coding agent, in a machine-readable format, off a TTY, or once the language server has run. The first-run telemetry notice is gone; [the telemetry page](https://nestjs.doctor/docs/telemetry) still documents every field and every opt-out.
- `NESTJS_DOCTOR_TELEMETRY_DEBUG=1` prints the language server's telemetry payload to stderr and sends nothing.
- Updated dependency: nestjs-doctor@0.9.6

## 4.1.1

### Patch Changes

- b0bc3c2: Fixes CI classification in telemetry for both the CLI and the language server. A shared `ci.<provider>` identity is now minted only when a known provider variable matches; a bare `CI` env var keeps the personal install id (the CLI records `ci_provider: "unknown"`) instead of merging the run into an anonymous machine pool. The provider table expands from 6 to 34 systems (TeamCity, Azure Pipelines, Bitbucket Pipelines, CodeBuild, Drone, Render, and others), so automated runners that set none of the previous variables are no longer counted as individual users.

## 4.1.0

### Changed

- Findings that cannot affect the score or fail a build now surface as hints instead of warnings, matching diagnostic surfaces in `nestjs-doctor@0.9.0`.

### Added

- Rescans when a `package.json` changes, so security-advisory findings appear and clear as dependencies change — no editor restart needed.

### Fixed

- Windows: findings did not attach to any file because paths with a drive prefix (`D:/proj/...`) were treated as relative.
- Windows: findings duplicated after the first edit because two caches keyed the same path differently.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 9676def: Fix empty npm publish and missing bin shebang. `nestjs-doctor-lsp@0.1.0` and `0.1.1` shipped without compiled code (only `package.json` and `LICENSE`) because the LSP build was never run before `changeset publish`, and the bin entrypoint (`dist/server.cjs`) was missing a `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang so editors couldn't spawn it via PATH. The LSP package now declares a `prepack` hook so `pnpm pack` always builds first, the root `build` script also covers the LSP, the bundler emits the shebang on the bin entry, and the package rejoins the normal Changesets release flow. Resolves #111.
