nestjs-doctor is a free, open-source static analysis tool for NestJS that
catches AI mistakes deterministically. It reads every `@Module()`, provider,
endpoint and ORM entity from source and reports findings across security,
correctness, architecture, performance and schema with a 0-100 score. No LLM
at scan time, so code from Copilot, Cursor or Claude Code scores the same on
your laptop and in CI.

Run it with `npx`, as a pre-commit hook, as a GitHub Action, in VS Code, or
from a coding-agent skill. The HTML report draws the module graph, endpoint
traces, an ER diagram for Prisma, TypeORM, Drizzle or MikroORM, and boot
timings from one real start. Monorepos work.

## Install

### 1. Quick start

Run this at your project root:

```bash
npx nestjs-doctor@latest .
```

[![nestjs-doctor scoring a project 35 out of 100, an agent fixing the findings, and a rescan scoring 100](https://www.nestjs.doctor/demo.svg)](https://www.nestjs.doctor)

A clean scan prints the score and nothing else. That is the expected result on
a project the rules already agree with, and `--report` still draws the module
graph, the traced endpoints and the schema diagram.

Add `--verbose` for file paths and line numbers.

### 2. Open the report

Build `nestjs-doctor-report.html`:

```bash
npx nestjs-doctor@latest . --report
```

Writes to the project root, or wherever `--output` names. One file: score
summary, findings with a code viewer, and an interactive module
graph. Traced HTTP endpoints, the schema ER diagram, and a
rule playground get their own tabs.
[Module graph docs →](https://www.nestjs.doctor/docs/report/module-graph)

The report's share button, and `--share-sections` on the CLI, write a JSON slice
of a scan: pick the score, a findings category, the endpoints, the schema, or the
module graph.
[Sharing docs →](https://www.nestjs.doctor/docs/report/share)

![Module Graph](https://www.nestjs.doctor/module-graph.png)

Add a few lines to `main.ts`, boot once, and `--timings` gives the report a
Boot trace tab. Every class sits on one absolute timeline, with a hover card
per bar and graph nodes that say what each module cost.
[Boot trace docs →](https://www.nestjs.doctor/docs/report/boot-trace)

### 3. Run in CI

Write `.github/workflows/nestjs-doctor.yml`:

```bash
npx nestjs-doctor@latest ci install
```

The action reviews every pull request and reports only what the change
introduced, not the existing backlog. It posts a sticky summary comment, inline
review comments on the changed lines, and a commit status with the score.

It never fails a check until you ask it to, unless the scanned directory holds
no TypeScript files, which exits 2. Set `blocking` or `min-score` when ready. [CI docs →](https://www.nestjs.doctor/docs/ci)

### 4. Install for agents

Install the agent skill:

```bash
npx nestjs-doctor@latest --init
```

Installs three skills: `nestjs-doctor` for scanning after a change,
`nestjs-boot-trace` for a slow start, and `nestjs-doctor-create-rule` for
conventions of your own. The first runs without being asked, after the agent
writes Nest code. Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, Windsurf,
Gemini CLI, and more.
[Agent docs →](https://www.nestjs.doctor/docs/coding-agents)

### 5. Configure rules

Optional. Drop a `nestjs-doctor.config.json` at your project root to turn rules
or categories off, set a score floor, or point at a custom rules directory:

```json
{
  "minScore": 80,
  "rules": {
    "performance/no-sync-io": false,
    "architecture/no-manual-instantiation": {
      "excludeClasses": ["Logger", "PinoLogger"]
    }
  },
  "categories": { "performance": false }
}
```

The same shape works as `.nestjs-doctor.json`, or as a `"nestjs-doctor"` key in
`package.json`.

[Custom rule configuration →](https://www.nestjs.doctor/docs/custom-rules)

## Rules

Every finding carries a file and a rule id you can suppress or configure, plus
a line unless it reports against a schema entity.

| Category | Rules | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| [Security](https://www.nestjs.doctor/docs/rules/security) | 12 | Hardcoded secrets, `eval`, weak crypto, TypeORM `synchronize: true`, endpoints with no guard, dependencies with a published advisory |
| [Correctness](https://www.nestjs.doctor/docs/rules/correctness) | 20 | Fire-and-forget promises, missing `@Injectable()`, lifecycle hooks without their interface, param decorators that do not match the route |
| [Architecture](https://www.nestjs.doctor/docs/rules/architecture) | 10 | ORM in controllers, business logic in controllers, circular module dependencies, manual instantiation instead of DI |
| [Performance](https://www.nestjs.doctor/docs/rules/performance) | 7 | Sync I/O, blocking constructors, request-scope abuse, orphan modules, unused providers |
| [Schema](https://www.nestjs.doctor/docs/rules/schema) | 3 | Missing primary keys, missing timestamps, relations with no `onDelete` |

Suppress a single finding inline:

```ts
// nestjs-doctor-ignore-next-line architecture/no-orm-in-controllers
constructor(private readonly prisma: PrismaService) {}
```

## Editors and tooling

- **VS Code:** [NestJS Doctor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rolobits.nestjs-doctor-vscode) surfaces the same rules as you type. [Docs →](https://www.nestjs.doctor/docs/vscode-extension)
- **Any other editor:** `npx nestjs-doctor-lsp --stdio` speaks LSP, so Neovim, Helix, and Emacs get the same rules. [Docs →](https://www.nestjs.doctor/docs/language-server)
- **Other CI:** GitLab Code Quality, SARIF for any code-scanning backend, or a markdown body to post yourself. [Docs →](https://www.nestjs.doctor/docs/ci)
- **Node API:** `diagnose()` plus an incremental API for editors and long-running processes. [Docs →](https://www.nestjs.doctor/docs/reference/node-api)
- **Monorepos:** detected from `nest-cli.json`, pnpm workspaces, `package.json` workspaces, Nx, or Lerna. [Docs →](https://www.nestjs.doctor/docs/pipeline/project-detection)

## Telemetry

The CLI reports rule errors and anonymous run data to help us catch bugs and prioritize work.

We collect:

- Environment: CLI version, platform, Node version, and how it ran (npx, script, the installed skill, a coding agent, or CI)
- Project shape: file count, framework, ORM, Nest version (NO file contents)
- Rules fired: rule ids and counts only (e.g. `security/no-eval`) (NO code or specific findings)
- Rules that threw during the scan
- Commands run: one `command_completed` event when `--init` or `ci install` finishes, with `command` (`init` or `ci_install`) and `from` (`flag` or `menu`)

To opt out, run: `npx nestjs-doctor@latest --no-telemetry`. [Details →](https://www.nestjs.doctor/docs/telemetry)
